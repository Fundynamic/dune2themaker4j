/**
 * This enum has types for all kind of facing for a specific TerrainType. (non-walls)
 *
 * The types are explained by looking at the graphical representation, and then pointing out
 * at what sides the terrain type is drawn.
 *
 * Example:
 * TerrainType = Rock
 * Looking at spritesheet, of rock.
 * The very first tile is a full rock tile, so the first type in the enum is FULL
 * The second tile (one to the right), is a tile with sand on the left, rock on the top, right, bottom.
 * (we go clockwise), so the enum is TOP_RIGHT_BOTTOM
