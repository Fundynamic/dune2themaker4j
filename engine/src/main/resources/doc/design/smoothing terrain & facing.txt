Smoothing terrain / Facing terrain types
========================================

Each cell has a 'facing'. Facing is determined by looking at adjacent cells.

Sometimes the facing cannot be determined due incompatible types of terrains.
Ie, because there is no transition from spice hill to rocks.

Smoothing is a process done once on startup, and on manipulations on map.

INPUT:
