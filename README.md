This project aims to deliver a complex `Real Time Simulation Role Playing Strategy Game`. If you want to get a feel of where this project will be going, check out the wiki pages.

## Getting started
This project is set up using [slick2d-maven](https://github.com/nguillaumin/slick2d-maven). 

You need `git` and `maven` installed. Also you need to have `java` version 1.7.

## Running the game
- `git clone` this project
- run `mvn clean package`
- in the `target/d2tm-<version>-SNAPSHOT-release` run `game.sh` (or `game.bat` depending on your OS)

## Progress
For every feature or improvement a small tech demo is created and posted at youtube. These demos are grouped by milestone:

## Development
Import the project using your favorite IDE.

If you want to `run` or `debug` the project (you need to execute `Game`), then you probably run into a `java.lang.UnsatifsiedLinkError`.

To fix that you need to add the following VM Arguments to your run configuration: `-Djava.library.path=target/natives`
